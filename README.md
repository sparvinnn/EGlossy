# EGlossy: An Energy-Efficient Glossy-Based Synchronization and Flooding Protocol in IoT

Network Flooding and synchronization are the foundation of a wide range of practical applications and network operations. 
A flooding service can implicitly synchronize all nodes of a network effectively. The integrated services should send packets 
as quickly as possible to reduce clock drift errors. In this study, we focus on Glossy protocol, which has a great performance 
in this regard. One of the disadvantages of this protocol is energy consumption increase with the expansion of the network. 
We propose EGlossy, which reduces the nodes radio on-time to 66 percent. To implement our contribution, LWB protocol has been 
used for network management. Implementation of EGlossy is tested on the Cooja simulator of Contiki operating system.

We used the code here: "https://github.com/csarkar/tailored-lwb" to implement this protocol and edited the necessary sections.
